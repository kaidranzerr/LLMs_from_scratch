# Langfuse --> evaluation of ai agents and LLMs
# agents takes you from point A to B in life and adds value || it also has access to tools || it interacts with external environment
# agent needs to have memory || human in loop for evaluation

# ai agent --> an ai model capable of reasoning , planning and interacting with it's environment
# an agent has agency --> ability to interact with it's environment

# agency level --> amount of control that agent has || highest multi agent --> one agentic workflow starts another agentic workflow
# language models are the brain of agents  

# an ability is emergent if it is not present in smaller models but present in larger models.
# parameters increases --> size increases --> something unexpected happens 

# tools are the weapons which an LLM recieves to interact with it's environment ex. web search || image generation || retrieval || API
# need to tell LLM that this tool exists and this is how we use it

# ReACT --> synergizing reasoning and Acting in Language Models 
# started with chain of thought prompting 
#  LLM + Reasoning + Acting  --> T(thought) A(Action) O(Observation)
# agents are LLMs equipped with tools || using react framework agents interact with external environment to add additional information
# into their reasoning

# agentic feameworks --> Code(Langgraph , langchain , LlamaIndex , Smolagents , Autogen) 
# , Low Code(crew AI , Langflow , n8n , Agno) , No-Code(Google Vortex AI Agent , Microsoft Copilot,  OpenAI custom GPT , Manus) 

# smol agents is open-source python library designed to make and run agents using just a few lines of code
# smolagents --> (vision + browser agents , code agents , tool calling agents , tools , agents)
# smolagents focuses on tool calls in code instead of json

# provider are those companies which hosts open source models

# conversation window buffer --> how much of past memory you want to retain
# smolagents focuses on tool calls in code instead of json
# toolCallingAgent --> lower complexity || structured and predictable | simple structured tasks || lower error risk
# codeAgent --> Higher complexity || high flexible and dynamic || complex unstructured tasks || can have runtime errors

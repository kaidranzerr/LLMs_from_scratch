# they are also known as skip connection or residual connections || to solve problem of vanishing gradient 
# gradients become progressively small as they propagate backwards 
# shortcut connection create an alternative path for the gradient to flow by skipping one or more layers 
# this is acheived by adding an output of a layer to a latter layer 
# +1 term keeps the gradient flowing through network
